Since PyPy doesn't support SciPy, it needs to be substituted
with something else or go for C++. Moved to Numpy, from > 40

Min load in the grid: 9.21 GW
5 EPR III+ gen: 6.66 GW
Daily: 159.84 GWh
Yearly consumption: 176.71 TWh
5 reactors: 58.34 TWh (33%)
2 reactors in Trino (VC)
3 reactors in Caorso (PC)

Hypothesis: 1/3 nuclear 1/3 gas 1/3 hydro
Result: 175 gCO2/kWh
North Italy is not windy and there's no so much
space for large solar installation
North Italy is densely populated, so power plants
are the best suitable solution
Improvements in hydro power should be considered
When baseload rises, Chioggia should be considered

Goal: 1/3 nuclear 1/2 hydro 1/6 gas
Result: 98 gCO2/kWh
