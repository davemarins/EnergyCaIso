6.37 MWh each

2017 natual gas data from government
61.55 Mtep total natural gas usage
21.21 Mtep for electricity generation (34,5%)
12.51 Mtep for industries (20.3%)
24.09 Mtep for civilian uses (39.1%)

0,868 tep each (civilian only)
10.1 MWh each (civilian only)

6.37 MWh each electricity
25.8 Mwh each natural gas

84% efficiency induction
40% efficiency burning

40.34 Mtep taken in consideration
let's assume that all this gas is used for heating
from burning to induction
16.14 Mtep obtained from burning
19.21 Mtep required electricity for the same purpose
223.4 TWh required annually (+126.4% in electricity production)

400.16 TWh yearly
Assumption: 75% consumption for 2/3 of Italian GDP
and 1/2 population with colder climate
300.12 TWh yearly for North Italy
Assumption: 75% base load 25% intermittent
